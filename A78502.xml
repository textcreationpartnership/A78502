            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many dayes and much time being Å¿pent in theÅ¿e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: and notice thereof being brought to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> he thought it very convenient to goe to the place of meeting, and there to make his application to that noble perÅ¿on who had Å¿tood up Å¿o much for his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t, and having at laÅ¿t attained to the end of his journey, (hoping to Crowne this beginning of his deÅ¿ires with Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e) he went privately to the Lord <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> who though Å¿omewhat aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed at his Å¿udden and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arrivall did yet nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e treate him with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary civilityes, the uÅ¿uall teÅ¿timonyes of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affection, with promiÅ¿e in convenient time to procure a meeting between themÅ¿elves, and the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> in which they would conÅ¿ult what was neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and what was fit to be done, whereby he Å¿hould Å¿ee, that no Å¿tone Å¿hould

            <p>According to his promiÅ¿e about the midÅ¿t of <hi>September</hi> laÅ¿t paÅ¿t the <hi>SpaniÅ¿h Grandee</hi> gained a meeting: where they after Å¿ome reÅ¿pects (each reÅ¿erving to himÅ¿elfe his own <hi>Grandezza, Don Lewis</hi> began; there hath been, Sir, Å¿ome controverÅ¿y between the Cardinall his <hi>Eminency</hi> and my Å¿elfe about your intereÅ¿t, I judging it neceÅ¿Å¿ary that upon a concluÅ¿ion of a peace between <hi>two</hi> the moÅ¿t potent Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> (a <hi>third</hi> being now diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed through the malevolent diÅ¿poÅ¿itions of ill affected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Å¿ubjects Å¿hould not be left out, whereunto the <hi>Cardinall</hi> replyed, I confeÅ¿Å¿e it is a work of charity and piety, but where the intereÅ¿t of the Å¿tate whereof I am a Å¿ubject, cannot but Å¿uffer by Å¿uch a conceÅ¿Å¿ion, I muÅ¿t crave pardon: you know or at the leaÅ¿t have heard, how the <hi>King</hi> my MaÅ¿ter was compelled to make a peace with the <hi>EngliÅ¿h State,</hi> and upon what unequall term we gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Å¿ame, he left many of his friends and kindred in the in the <hi>Lurch,</hi> and was glad to give <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and Å¿ome other places for the purchaÅ¿e therof. He was particularly bound to baniÅ¿h <hi>this noble perÅ¿on</hi> here preÅ¿ent and never to aide or aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him, but to take all perÅ¿ons, his friend, and allves to be our enemies, Å¿o that I cannot <hi>Å¿aluo honore regiae majeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> conclude any thing as to that point.</p>
            <p>And doth my <hi>CoÅ¿en</hi> truly (Å¿aid the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi>) Å¿o highly prize his Å¿o dearly bought peace: Å¿urely he cannot but know that the perÅ¿on with whom he made, it was no

            </p>
            <p>Truly Å¿aid <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and that poÅ¿Å¿ibly might be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne of both; for I know the <hi>King of Spain</hi> was tampered with, to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e and when by policy and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the effect could not be attained, then Å¿traight a <hi>war</hi> was included with <hi>Spaine, Jamarca</hi> Å¿eized on by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with Å¿ome few other places Å¿tollen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by craft, but I really beleive, that if they Å¿hould take a veiw of their <hi>TreaÅ¿ury</hi> and but reckon the <hi>men</hi> thoÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿iderable places have coÅ¿t them, they would quickly find the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>treaÅ¿ure</hi> hugely to over-ballance the <hi>worth</hi> thereof. For what advantage have they gotten thereby for <hi>Jamaica</hi> is Å¿o poore a place, that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall freÅ¿h Å¿upplyes the Å¿ouldyary and people there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119230:4"/>muÅ¿t <hi>Å¿tarve,</hi> and then obÅ¿erve but the danger of bringing in proviÅ¿ion, the place being wholly invironed with IÅ¿lands under the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> dominion well fortified, well attended on by Å¿hips and populouÅ¿ly rich and the whole place will not countervaile either half the danger or charge. And as for <hi>Dunkirk</hi> which they boaÅ¿t is the key into <hi>Flanders,</hi> if they can make no better uÅ¿e thereof for the future, then they have hitherto done, it may poÅ¿Å¿ibly prove to them <hi>mors in olla,</hi> a thing of Å¿o hard a digeÅ¿tion that their greedy Å¿tomacks Å¿hall be forced to reÅ¿tore, let it be as it will, quoth the <hi>Cardinll,</hi> we Å¿hall endeavour to hold out own and neither meddle in the Å¿ettling or unÅ¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Common-wealths or Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>'Tis well, anÅ¿wered the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> but you were I am Å¿ure of another minde when <hi>you</hi> were <hi>baniÅ¿hed</hi> out of <hi>France:</hi> but the wheele with you was quickly round, thanks to your policy, and <hi>Machiavellian</hi> principles: but as to the maine point for this is but beating about the buÅ¿h, my deÅ¿ire is that as in this happy treaty and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of a peace, and a marriage, moÅ¿t of the Princes, and Å¿tates of <hi>Europe</hi> will have a Å¿hare of happineÅ¿Å¿e, I alone may not be Å¿et aÅ¿ide: and I am very well aÅ¿Å¿ured, that if my condition (as being moÅ¿t wrongfully expulÅ¿ed out of my <hi>Fathers</hi> Kingdome and <hi>my</hi> lawfull inheritance) were but taken in among the reÅ¿t of your friends, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿enÅ¿e thereof would Å¿o move other neighbour Princes and Å¿tates, that they would Å¿uddenly turn their many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es into actions, and inÅ¿tead of <hi>words</hi> aide me with Swords.</p>
            <p>I muÅ¿t deale ingeniouÅ¿ly with you, Å¿aid <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> it is the intent of my <hi>MaÅ¿ter</hi> to take you in as an Ally and Friend: and I am Å¿ure having him, you gaine the whole
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119230:5"/>houÅ¿e of <hi>AuÅ¿tria,</hi> who by reaÅ¿on of their great power and Å¿way in the <hi>Empire,</hi> (as having the Emperor of their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) command the cheife and greateÅ¿t part of <hi>Europe:</hi> for by that meanes all the <hi>Catholike</hi> Princes there will be aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tant: and if you but weigh the alliance between theÅ¿e, the <hi>Dane,</hi> the <hi>Pole,</hi> and Å¿everall others, in the whole, it will be found that two third parts of <hi>Europe</hi> will all follow.</p>
            <p>I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e replyed the Cardinall, you have Å¿aid much to the purpoÅ¿e, the Leagues and Alliances you have Å¿poken of are many and very Å¿trong, but moÅ¿t of them will find buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e enough to defend themÅ¿elves againÅ¿t the <hi>Swede</hi> and his partakers, for though by the new League they may Å¿eem Å¿orely to threaten him, yet he is able by <hi>HimÅ¿elfe</hi> and his <hi>Confederates</hi> (as he hath done Å¿ome years already) to find them imployment at home.</p>
            <p>Indeed (retorted the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi>) I think your cheif hopes is on the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who if I be not miÅ¿taken, is in the <hi>League</hi> with your Eminencyes MaÅ¿ter, as alÅ¿o with <hi>my Enemies:</hi> but I hope (and Å¿omething I have of confidence to aÅ¿Å¿ure me thereof) that the <hi>MarqueÅ¿s</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> (not to mention <hi>my CoÅ¿en</hi> of the <hi>Palatanate</hi>) who is late joyned with the <hi>Emperor</hi> and houÅ¿e of <hi>AuÅ¿tria,</hi> will Å¿o pull his fethers, that on a Å¿udden he Å¿hall not flye farre abroad.</p>
            <p>It may be Å¿o (anÅ¿wered the Cardinall) but now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all your hopes to be certainties, they will little availe, for his <hi>HolineÅ¿Å¿e</hi> is not at all thought of : and with out all diÅ¿pute he will goe farre in <hi>Italy:</hi> 'tis true, <hi>Italy</hi> is divided into four parts, viz. <hi>Lumbardy, TuÅ¿cany,</hi> St. <hi>Peters Patrimony;</hi> and <hi>the Kingdome of Naples:</hi> In <hi>Lumbardy</hi> Å¿tand many rich Governments, as the Dukedome of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne</hi> (which is my MaÅ¿ters) of <hi>Mantua,</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119230:5"/>others of leÅ¿Å¿e note: none of which you have mentioned; theÅ¿e together St. <hi>Peters Patrimony,</hi> and the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> are all at his <hi>HolineÅ¿s</hi> beck.</p>
            <p>What then (anÅ¿wered <hi>Don Lewis</hi>) is not my <hi>MaÅ¿ter</hi> the eldeÅ¿t Å¿on of the <hi>Church?</hi> I am confident his <hi>HolineÅ¿s</hi> will as Å¿oon bend towards him as the greateÅ¿t. Is not the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> his? are not you to deliver him the Dukedome of <hi>Millayne?</hi> Doth not he keep a good Fleet of Galleyes at <hi>Otrauto</hi> continually, which is the neereÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿age from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> to prevent any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaÅ¿ion from the <hi>Turkes:</hi> why then Å¿hould <hi>he</hi> have leÅ¿Å¿e hopes of his <hi>HolineÅ¿s</hi> then <hi>you.</hi> And I dare preÅ¿ume that if his MajeÅ¿ty of <hi>Scotland</hi> here preÅ¿ent will be but <hi>reconciled</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> all difficulties will Å¿o eaÅ¿ily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: that he Å¿hall but ask and have Men, moneys, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Ships, and what not, without the help or thanks of your MaÅ¿ter, or his Freinds who have already once <hi>apoÅ¿tatized</hi> from him.</p>
            <p>I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e (anÅ¿wered the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi>) I would very willingly be <hi>reinÅ¿tated</hi> in my Kingdomes and would even give, <hi>forgive,</hi> grant or doe any thing even beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to be hoped from me to come to that happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, but to Å¿eek or gain them, and to looÅ¿e or hazard my hopes of <hi>Heaven,</hi> I dare not, I cannot, for I Å¿hall Å¿ooner chooÅ¿e to dye an <hi>exile</hi> from my <hi>native</hi> Country then to baniÅ¿h or change the <hi>Religion</hi> I have been bred and born in for a Å¿ettlement there.</p>
            <p>Alas (anÅ¿wered the Cardinall) what is your <hi>Religion</hi> but a new fangle, a thing never thought of till <hi>Luther</hi>'s time. I deny that (replyed the <hi>King</hi>) for it is the <hi>Å¿ame</hi> in its purity which was profeÅ¿Å¿ed in the <hi>primitive</hi> Church, Å¿o that it is as old as ChriÅ¿tianity at Å¿elfe: and all along
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119230:6"/>hath been upheld (but with Å¿ome mixtures I muÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e) I need not Å¿ay much herein, a great part of the World are therein as well Å¿atisfied as my Å¿elfe.</p>
            <p>Yea (replyed <hi>Don Lewis</hi>) but you cannot Å¿hew that it was ever <hi>openly</hi> preached or profeÅ¿Å¿ed till of <hi>late</hi> dayes.</p>
            <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e (anÅ¿wered the <hi>King</hi>) your excellency in this point is miÅ¿informed, what think you of the <hi>WaldenÅ¿es,</hi> of <hi>John Wickliffe</hi> who openly preached and upheld the Å¿ame even in the publick and famous UniverÅ¿ity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi> and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of LancaÅ¿ter, and other great men of that time: Were <hi>John HuÅ¿Å¿e</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> no body, who in defence thereof, both Å¿acrificed their lives. It is founded upon the word of God, and is the Å¿ame which is taught in the Doctrine of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> yea by <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> himÅ¿elfe, and his <hi>ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> and is of greater antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then that which is grounded but upon the <hi>decrees</hi> of <hi>counÅ¿els</hi> and <hi>humane traditions:</hi> but I Å¿hall not argue any further thereof, for I am no <hi>Prophet,</hi> nor no Prophets Son.</p>
            <p>But quoth the Cardinall this <hi>obÅ¿tinacy</hi> will never do you good: your <hi>Father</hi> might have Å¿till b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en a King, or you his peacefull SucceÅ¿Å¿or, if he had not been <hi>Å¿o reÅ¿olutely</hi> bent in theÅ¿e points: And for this very cauÅ¿e, I take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againÅ¿t you: you know what <hi>Machiavell</hi> Å¿aith, It matters not whether a Prince have <hi>Religion</hi> or no, Å¿o he make a pretence thereof Å¿ufficient to Å¿erve his own ends: you muÅ¿t learne to transforme your Å¿elfe into any Å¿hape, for <hi>Qui neÅ¿cit diÅ¿Å¿imulare, neÅ¿cit regnare.</hi> It is uÅ¿ually found in CounÅ¿els of <hi>State,</hi> that the <hi>buÅ¿ie</hi> heads of a few doe carry <hi>all</hi> the reÅ¿t: And many times Men make a Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of their own judgements to <hi>him</hi> that hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119230:6"/>a name by giving happy directions in troubles <hi>forepast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A faire Argument hath your <hi>Eminency</hi> uÅ¿ed (Å¿aid the <hi>King</hi>) but I doubt hardly Å¿ufficient to work on me: for I am like <hi>Antigonus</hi> (one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Captaines) who was as good a Man of Warre, of as deep judgment, as high a Å¿pirit, and as great undertaking as any of the reÅ¿t, but his <hi>employment</hi> was leÅ¿Å¿e, which made him leÅ¿Å¿e reÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but his thoughts were as high as theirs, for he valued himÅ¿elfe by his own worth, not by the opinion of others, in like manner, I though at preÅ¿ent kept an <hi>exile</hi> by thoÅ¿e who ought to be my Subjects, have yet nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>thoughts</hi> of a <hi>King:</hi> for why may not the Å¿ame providence that caÅ¿t me of, put me in again, <hi>Saepe redit pulÅ¿Ã¢ nube Å¿erena dies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In truth (Å¿aid <hi>Don Lewis</hi>) your reÅ¿olution is much to be commended, and generally we finde good Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e to be the reward of a well grounded patience, and if you can with the contented minde of <hi>Socrates,</hi> conclude that every place is the wiÅ¿e Mans Country, and all parts a Palace to a quiet minde, you will not miÅ¿Å¿e the reward of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for <hi>Saepe premente Deo fert Deus alter opem.</hi> And for my own part, I do here proteÅ¿t to your MajeÅ¿ty, that I Å¿hall in what I may aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t you, and that I will be earneÅ¿t with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> my MaÅ¿ter to that purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>But I pray (quoth the Cardinall) let not your <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> be over haÅ¿ty, for Å¿ince it hath pleaÅ¿ed the divine providence to bring the affaires of theÅ¿e two <hi>great Crownes</hi> to Å¿o hopefull a period: I hope this Å¿hall not be any cauÅ¿e of breach, and therefore Å¿hall rather honour this <hi>noble Prince</hi> with the title of freind: Some of his <hi>evill-willers</hi> we have Å¿een to <hi>fall,</hi> thoÅ¿e that have riÅ¿en have waded through
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119230:7"/>a <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>blood:</hi> And thoÅ¿e that now remaine are ready to deÅ¿troy one another about <hi>parting the Stakes,</hi> I wiÅ¿h there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effects may prove Å¿ucceÅ¿sfull, and that the event of our conference may be a happy amen towards his Å¿ettlement.</p>
            <p>Yet if you pleaÅ¿e (quoth <hi>Don Lewis</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>) I Å¿hall not adviÅ¿e you to truÅ¿t to the <hi>inconÅ¿tancy</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Nation: but rather that you will goe to the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where your <hi>retreate</hi> Å¿hall be warranted and <hi>Å¿afe,</hi> whereupon after many congratulation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> on both Å¿ides at the preÅ¿ent they parted.</p>
            <p>This is the exact relation of the conference, as neere as poÅ¿Å¿ibly could be gathered, which for publick Å¿atisfaction I have here made publick, that the World may Å¿ee that that poor baniÅ¿hed <hi>Prince</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> is neither Å¿o helpleÅ¿s nor freindleÅ¿s as many Men imagine.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this conference ended, the <hi>King</hi> took his courÅ¿e directly for the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where according to information from thence Å¿ince received, he is Å¿afely arrived, and with courteÅ¿ie and humanity enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
